## Important Files / Model Download

Due to its large size (approx. 460 MB), the trained machine learning model (`best_fire_detection_model.pkl`) is hosted on Google Drive.

You can download the model directly from here:
[**Download Trained Fire Classification Model**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v22TR1rT0qUmJdxUHquUCe_jxugoFnlm/view?usp=sharing)

*(Note: The `scaler.pkl` file is also available in the repository directly if it's under 100MB, or you can link it here if it's also large.)*
